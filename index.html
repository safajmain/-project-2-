            when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</h1>
       <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion <br>
            for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles <br> 
            and Tokyo.</h1>
       <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We <br>
           come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are <br>
           self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each <br>
           of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music <br>
           culture.</p>

       <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their <br>
          magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly <br>
          diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree <br>
          with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>
